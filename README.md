# OmegaT Website

This is the website for OmegaT, the best computer-assisted translation tool. You can access the actual website here: <https://omegat.org/>.

The website is built with Jekyll.

## Development

An easy way to quickly test changes you've made to the website is to use docker as a local server.
Navigate to the root folder of the project. You can build the image by running:

```bash
docker build -t omegat-site:dev .
```

If the build succeeds, you can then start a container by running:

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 omegat-site:dev
```

You can then access the website locally at `localhost:4000` or `http://127.0.0.1:4000`

You can kill the server using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> shortcut in the CLI.

## Pull Requests

We use automated snapshot testing on pull requests.
The goal is to make it easier for us to update our dependencies.
So we check if the html pages generated by Jekyll match what we expect.

This is especially useful when updating dependencies or anything that shouldn't affect the content.
And when editing the content, the build results shows us what has changed and makes it easier to see we're only changing what we want to change.

How it works: the GitHub Action pulls the target branch, build the website and creates tests to check for any changes in the generated files. Then we pull the PR branch and run the tests against it. If there are any changes in the generated files, the tests will fail.
