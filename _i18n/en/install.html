        <h2>Install OmegaT</h2>
        </div>
        <p>OmegaT comes in two editions:</p>
        <div>
          <dl>
            <dt>
              <span>Standard: OmegaT {{site.data.versions.standard.name}}</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>This edition is recommended for everyday use.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <span>Developer: OmegaT Nightly</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>This edition is automatically generated every time new
                code is added to OmegaT. It is used for testing
                purposes.</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </div>
        <p>The files are downloadable directly from <a href="https://omegat.org/download"
            target="_top">https://omegat.org</a>.</p>
        <div class="note">
          <h4>Note</h4>
          <p>OmegaT {{site.data.versions.standard.name}} requires a Java {{site.data.versions.standard.java_version}} Runtime
            Environment (JRE) to run.</p>
          <p>OmegaT packages are available both in versions bundled with Java, and
            versions without it. Packages without Java rely on a Java {{site.data.versions.standard.java_version}} Runtime
            Environment
            installed systemwide.
          </p>
      <p>OmegaT {{site.data.versions.standard.name}} and later also support Java 11 Runtime Environment on any
        platforms.</p>
      <p>Due to licensing considerations, the OmegaT team recommends the Java
        runtime Eclipse Temurin provided by the Eclipse Foundation's Adoptium Project, but any Java
        {{site.data.versions.standard.java_version}}
        compatible runtime environment should work.</p>

            <h3>On Windows</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Double-click on the package you downloaded.</p>
          <p>You can choose the language used during the installation and the
            language used by OmegaT. You can also change this later by editing
            <code class="filename">OmegaT.l4J.ini</code>.

            <h3>On Linux</h3>
      </div>
      <p>Some Linux distributions offer OmegaT in their package manager. The
        instructions given here apply to people who download the package from the
        <a href="https://omegat.org/download" target="_top">https://omegat.org</a>
        site and install it manually.
      </p>
      <p>Unpack/untar the file you downloaded. This creates a new
        folder named after the package you downloaded. That folder contains
        all the files needed to run OmegaT.</p>
      <div class="note">
        <h4>Note</h4>
        <p>Although you can run OmegaT directly from the available
          files, you can also run the <code>linux-install.sh</code>
          script found there to have OmegaT installed in more appropriate
          locations.</p>
        <p>Running the script will require you to enter your
          <code class="filename">sudo</code> password.
        </p>
        <p>The script checks for an existing installation of the same
          OmegaT version in <code class="filename">/opt/omegat/</code>. If there isn’t
          one, it installs the program in
          <code class="filename">/opt/omegat/OmegaT_{{site.data.versions.standard.name}}</code> and sets it as the
          default version (in
          <code class="filename">/opt/omegat/OmegaT-default</code>).
        </p>
        </div>
      <p>After the unpacking or installation is complete, you can
        delete the downloaded file as it is no longer needed.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <div>
            <h3>On macOS</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Double click on the package you downloaded to unpack it. This
            creates a folder called <code class="filename">OmegaT</code>. The folder contains
            two files: <code class="filename">index.html</code> (the user guide index) and
            <code class="filename">OmegaT.app</code> (the application). Copy the folder to a
            suitable location (e.g. <code class="filename">Applications</code>).
      </p>
      <p>Eventually, drag and drop <code class="filename">OmegaT.app</code> onto the
        Dock to easily access it.</p>
      <p>Once you have done this, you can delete the downloaded file as it
        is no longer needed.</p>

              <h3>On other platforms</h3>
            </div>
        <p>This information applies to all systems that have a Java version
          compatible with Java {{site.data.versions.standard.java_version}} Runtime Environment. That includes the platforms
          described
          above, but also the platforms for which specific packages are not
          provided.</p>

        <h4>Note</h4>
        <p>If you decide to install a new version, keep the following in
          mind:</p>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>OmegaT’s preferences are stored in the configuration folder
                and will <span class="emphasis">
                  <em>not</em>
                </span> be modified by the new version.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Projects that you have created in the past or are currently
                using will <span class="emphasis">
                  <em>not</em>
                </span> be modified or deleted. OmegaT
                projects are <span class="emphasis">
                  <em>not</em>
                </span> stored inside OmegaT. They are
                separate objects that have no physical connection to the OmegaT
                application itself.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Parameter files that are included in the downloaded OmegaT
                package (especially the <code class="filename">OmegaT.l4J.ini</code> for Windows and the
                <code class="filename">Configuration.properties</code> and
                <code class="filename">Info.plist</code> files for macOS packages) might be
                overwritten or deleted, so you may want to create a backup before
                upgrading, if you have been using these files to modify OmegaT’s
                launch parameters.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The <code class="filename">plugins</code> and
                <code class="filename">scripts</code> folders might be overwritten, so you
                may want to create a backup before upgrading.
              </p>

            <span>Over an existing version</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>To do this, simply select the same installation folder as the
              existing installation when installing
              the new version. The “old” version
              of OmegaT will be overwritten, but settings made from the OmegaT
              interface will be retained in the various configurations folders (see
              above).</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span>Alongside an existing
              version</span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This will enable you to keep any number of versions side-by-side,
              which you may wish to do until you feel comfortable with the new
              version.</p>
            <p>All the parameters located in the Configuration Folder will
              be shared unless you specify a different configuration folder with the
              <code class="literal">--config-dir=&lt;path&gt;</code> option from the OmegaT
              options on the
              command line . All the parameters located in a Project Folder will apply to
              that project regardless of which version of OmegaT opens it.
